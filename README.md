## What

Filter Hugo posts using multiple tags.

## Warning 

Not tested on sites with a very large number of posts.

## Where 

See Demo, with tags, authors and sections as filters: [https://pointy.netlify.com/filter/](https://pointy.netlify.com/filter/)

Demo with tags only, and using Masonry: [https://pointy.netlify.com/tags/](https://pointy.netlify.com/tags/)

## How 

Documentation here: [https://pointy.netlify.com/filter/](https://pointy.netlify.com/filter/)

## TODO: 

- Improve documentation

- Add function to update tags counts
  - Scenario: Author1 has only 1 post, tagged `red`. Selecting Author2 filter should show tag `red` as 0 or disabled.

- Possibly add option to choose AND vs OR 
  - Currently (OR within a filter set) + (AND between filter sets) 

- Add deselect all option
